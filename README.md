FLEXBOX BASICS:
	Before you begin using flexbox in your layouts, you should understand the terminology and concepts behind flexbox.

	Flexbox, or Flexible Box Layout is a set of CSS properties that proved a flexible way to layout page content. It's redefined how web designers build layouts.

	With Flexbox you can change the direction, size and order or elements, like navigation links, content columns and images, regardless of their original size and order in the HTML. This makes building responsive layouts that scale from small mobile devices to large desktop screens easier than ever.

FLEXBOX LAYOUT:
	The two most important elements in flexbox layout are flex containers and flex items.

	The flex container sets the context for flexbox layout; it contains flex items, the actual elements you layout using flexbox.

	Every direct child of a flex container is called a flex item; there can be any number of flex items inside a flex container.

	Once the children are flex items, you can take advantage of flexboxes powerful alignment properties.

	Flexbox follows two axes that determine the layout direction of flex items: main axis and cross axis.

	The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out; it defines the direction of flex items in the flex container.

	The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.
	
	Each axis has a start side and an end side.
	
	The default main-start and main-end direction of the main axis is left-to-right.

	The the default direction of the cross axis is top-to-bottom.
